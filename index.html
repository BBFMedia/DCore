          <h2>DCore</h2>

<p>DCore is a simple lightweight PHP framework. DCore was never intended to be a 
replacement for other frameworks, but has grown to maturity and felt sharing it 
would not hurt. Plus would force for better code standards and documentation.</p>

<p>Second motive is to create a XHP UI framework. The XHP framework would site on top
of DCore and reply on it. DCore would not depend on the XHP framework.</p>

<p>Can try the <a href="docs/tutorials.md">tutorials</a></p>

<h1>Status</h1>

<p>Currently many items need to be worked on. </p>

<p>Unit testing is not in the repository but I hope to add them soon.</p>

<h1>DCore Archetcture</h1>

<p>The code is light weight enough that on could step through the execution of the sample 
application and have a good understanding of the entire project.</p>

<p>Below is a description of the execution made by a DCore apps. "*" files are files in the
application not in the framework.</p>

<pre><code>*index.php
 |  DCore               includes DCore 
 |  |                   DCore include *'config.php' in you application
 |  |                   and creates singlton global _$registry_ global
 |  |
 |  |   $registry       calls $register-&gt;load() to load all modules defined in *_config.php_
 |      |               $register-&gt;load() loads each module such as cache, router 
 |      |   module      by calling module-&gt;init();
 |      |   
 |      |   plugins     if plugins is a module in your config then plugins-&gt;init() is called
 |          |           and will include each plugin witheither %plugin%\init.php is included 
 |          |           or create the plugin class
 |  |   |               include *init.php
 |
 |  router              *index.php call $registry-&gt;router-&gt;loader() 
 |  |                   takes url and finds controler and action
 |  |   *controller     router calls the controller-&gt;$action()
 |      |               controller does contoller things:)
 |
 |  template            your *index.php can call a view choice 
 |  |                   by calling template which intern finds the view
 |  |
 |  |    view            renders view              
 |
 |                      index.php eachos out the view
