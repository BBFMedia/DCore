DCore was never intended to be a \r\nreplacement for other frameworks, but has grown to maturity and felt sharing it \r\nwould not hurt. Plus would force for better code standards and documentation.\r\n\r\nSecond motive is to create a XHP UI framework. The XHP framework would site on top\r\nof DCore and reply on it. DCore would not depend on the XHP framework.\r\n\r\nCan try the [tutorials](docs/tutorials.md)\r\n\r\n\r\nStatus\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCurrently many items need to be worked on. \r\n\r\nUnit testing is not in the repository but I hope to add them soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDCore Archetcture\r\n================\r\nThe code is light weight enough that on could step through the execution of the sample \r\napplication and have a good understanding of the entire project.\r\n\r\nBelow is a description of the execution made by a DCore apps. \"*\" files are files in the\r\napplication not in the framework.\r\n\r\n```\r\n*index.php\r\n |  DCore               includes DCore \r\n |  |                   DCore include *'config.php' in you application\r\n |  |                   and creates singlton global _$registry_ global\r\n |  |\r\n |  |   $registry       calls $register->load() to load all modules defined in *_config.php_\r\n |      |               $register->load() loads each module such as cache, router \r\n |      |   module      by calling module->init();\r\n |      |   \r\n |      |   plugins     if plugins is a module in your config then plugins->init() is called\r\n |          |           and will include each plugin witheither %plugin%\\init.php is included \r\n |          |           or create the plugin class\r\n |  |   |               include *init.php\r\n |\r\n |  router              *index.php call $registry->router->loader() \r\n |  |                   takes url and finds controler and action\r\n |  |   *controller     router calls the controller->$action()\r\n |      |               controller does contoller things:)\r\n |\r\n |  template            your *index.php can call a view choice \r\n |  |                   by calling template which intern finds the view\r\n |  |\r\n |  |    view            renders view              \r\n |\r\n |                      index.php eachos out the view\r\n```","google":"","name":"Dcore"}
